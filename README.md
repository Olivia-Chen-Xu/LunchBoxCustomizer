# Lunchbox-Customizer
## Java Swing GUI Project
This program allows users to customize a lunchbox. 

Users can select different lunchbox sizes by choosing a size from the scrollpane, customize their lunchbox color by clicking "Choose a color" and then choosing a color from a color picker dialog. 

They can then add food to their lunchbox by clicking the buttons that have the names of the food.  

Once a button is clicked, the food that has its name on the button will show up in the lunchbox. 

They can also “fill up” their water bottle using a slider and adding a nametag on the bottle by typing in the textfield and clicking "add".

If they don't like their choice of food or they would like to give it another try, they can click "Restart" and everything will be back to its default setting.
